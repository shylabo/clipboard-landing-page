# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page

![Design preview for the Clipboard landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This challenge helps you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
6. Use the browser's dev tools to help you debug and fix any issues.
7. Commit and push your code regularly.

## Submitting your solution

Make sure you have the latest version of the code on your remote repository.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
